Resolve the exact current `main` SHA at execution time under `GH-004`.

## Accepted product boundary

The completed `v0.4.x` line and the post-release `_2` corrective are accepted owner-live unless fresh evidence contradicts them.

Key facts include:

- Model C is the only normal production Stage-60 runtime;
- Strategy Lab supports domain and canonical IPv4 targets;
- optional Host/SNI keeps service identity separate from a fixed IPv4 destination;
- fixed-IP final profiles include `--ipset-ip=<target>` and exact replay;
- authenticated/intercepted HTTP `4xx`/`5xx` remains valid DPI-path evidence;
- bare IPv4 TLS identity failure reports `PARTIAL` + Host/SNI guidance;
- bare-IP QUIC without Host/SNI is skipped before execution;
- Host/SNI QUIC performs real fixed-IP hostname-verified attempts;
- Generic UDP remains independent;
- Enable QUIC defaults OFF, is explicit/persisted, and its reload/revisit persistence is owner-live accepted;
- Strategy Lab cleanup/restoration remains mandatory;
- Settings Apply validation/guards and post-Apply service-state correctness remain accepted;
- Strategy Lab owns its visible Generic UDP file-picker labels, so RU/EN presentation follows OPNsense language rather than browser/OS native file-input chrome;
- the owner verified the `_2` localized picker and file-selection path on the live appliance.

## Closed `v0.5.0_2` corrective

The English localization leak (`Выбор файла` / `Не выбран ни один файл` rendered by the browser/OS) was corrected by hiding the visible native file-input chrome and rendering Laboratory-owned picker text.

The source correction, full CI/FreeBSD-15 qualification, testing-package publication, publication-record tail and focused owner-live check are complete. The owner confirmed that `v0.5.0_2` works as intended. No further source change belongs to this scope.

## Immediate next action

Start the next selected reliability regression: **Strategy Lab cancellation/internal-failure containment**.

The goal is evidence first, not an assumed patch: exercise cancellation and controlled internal-failure paths, then verify that Strategy Lab always reaches mandatory restoration, leaves no temporary runtime/firewall/process residue, preserves the pre-job Zapret2 service/configuration state, and reports the terminal state truthfully. Only confirmed defects should advance to a package revision.

Do not reactivate closed Model A/B/C, BLOB/Lua/discovery or timeout research without fresh evidence or a new owner instruction.
