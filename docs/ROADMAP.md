## `v0.5.0_2` file-picker localization corrective — COMPLETE

Fresh owner evidence selected a concrete post-release defect: the visible Generic UDP browser-native file picker could show Russian browser/OS labels while OPNsense/Strategy Lab was set to English.

- [x] identify browser-native `<input type="file">` chrome as the localization leak
- [x] keep the real native input only as the hidden file-selection mechanism
- [x] add Strategy Lab-owned RU/EN picker button and filename text
- [x] preserve selected filename, busy-state disabling, FileReader/Base64 staging and 1–4096-byte validation
- [x] add regression coverage forbidding return of the visible native `form-control` file picker
- [x] exact-head complete CI — run `31917466421`
- [x] FreeBSD 15 package qualification — run `31917466421`
- [x] exact squash merge for `v0.5.0_2` — `1ae952185dbae80ec34c0a89b441feddbe8b403a`
- [x] persistent GitHub testing-package publication — `v0.5.0_2`, workflow `31917806438`
- [x] bounded publication-record reconciliation — PR `#270` merged, generated evidence state closed afterward
- [x] focused owner-live RU/EN file-picker verification — **OWNER-LIVE PASS**

Testing package: `os-zapret2-restyle-0.5.0_2.pkg`.

SHA-256: `d89bc45162ca760320cf59e4a861b2b8ef7bc30bcb05f4338b2078c57b4980f5`.

Testing publication evidence: [`verification/evidence/testing-publications/v0.5.0_2.md`](verification/evidence/testing-publications/v0.5.0_2.md).

Owner-live evidence: [`verification/evidence/2026-08-16-v0.5.0_2-file-picker-owner-live-pass.md`](verification/evidence/2026-08-16-v0.5.0_2-file-picker-owner-live-pass.md).

The stable Pages/pkg repository remains on `v0.5.0_1`; `_2` was not automatically promoted.

## `v0.5.0_3` current testing line — TELEGRAM VOICE LAB ACTIVE

- [x] keep package identity at `VERSION=0.5.0`, `PLUGIN_REVISION=3`
- [x] retire the `e3069322...` binary from active laboratory use
- [x] pin the only active tgcalls oracle to `efd330ca04f74706024a5abdfb5b41f4e4dd1065`
- [x] require a local P2P smoke gate and SHA-256 manifest for that current oracle
- [x] qualify current `efd330ca...` build/runtime on TNAS — **OWNER-LIVE PASS**, SHA-256 `7ad8a2eef607e92056e8e8311519d36616c45ca19f1403601bbed8e8db01f3dc`
- [x] record owner runtime update to Zapret2 v1.0.5.2 for future live candidate epochs
- [x] keep this change lab/docs-only; no package payload or revision bump

## Telegram voice / UDP DPI-bypass — PHASE C TEMPORARY CONSOLE ORACLE

Owner-selected authority: [`research/TELEGRAM_VOICE_UDP.md`](research/TELEGRAM_VOICE_UDP.md).

Current architecture: [`architecture/TELEGRAM_VOICE_EMULATION_LAB.md`](architecture/TELEGRAM_VOICE_EMULATION_LAB.md).

- [x] complete Phase A/B observation and zero-fake runtime/network interpretation
- [x] pin Zapret2 `v1.0.4` and preserve unpublished `_4` work
- [x] build/digest-pin the TOS/Linux `tgcalls_cli` companion
- [x] pass the local P2P build/runtime gate
- [x] select fixed current endpoint `91.108.13.10:596`
- [x] preserve the historical exact-endpoint `MEDIA_PASS` through TNAS gateway `192.168.1.140` as context; do not treat it as a fresh independent control for the current oracle
- [x] establish that Docker `host` has no independent container IP/MAC
- [x] retain only the existing TOS/Docker `host` network by owner instruction
- [x] reject GUI and permanent Telegram Voice laboratory integration
- [ ] establish temporary key-only SSH command execution from OPNsense to TNAS
- [ ] transact `91.108.13.10/32` on TNAS through `192.168.1.2`, with exact restoration to `192.168.1.140`
- [x] run current tgcalls against `91.108.13.10:596` through OPNsense with no desynchronization and capture LAN/WAN truth — **WIRE_OK / NO_REPLY_UNKNOWN**; 60/60 outbound packets survive forwarding/NAT, zero inbound replies
- [x] establish from current capture that the reflector baseline is non-STUN 40-byte Hello traffic; paused STUN-only `_4` is not a direct candidate
- [ ] use temporary, non-packaged OPNsense-console scripts for exact-flow/exact-endpoint non-STUN candidates
- [ ] test reflector fragmentation: position 8 ordered, position 8 reverse, then evidence-driven alternates
- [ ] add correlated TURN Allocate only as a secondary oracle
- [ ] repeat any winner and complete one final remote P2P-disabled real call
- [ ] remove temporary SSH/route/scripts, archive evidence and decide `_4`

Phase C control evidence: [`verification/evidence/2026-09-05-telegram-voice-fixed-reflector-control-pass.md`](verification/evidence/2026-09-05-telegram-voice-fixed-reflector-control-pass.md).

No GUI, permanent lab controller/API/daemon, Generic UDP semantic change or Telegram Voice lab package subsystem belongs to this work. Package identity remains `0.5.0_3`.

## Remaining regression / future backlog

These rows remain useful coverage or future product directions. They are **not** silently release debt for the completed stable `v0.5.0` release.

- [ ] cancellation/internal-failure containment regression
- [ ] circular lifecycle start/stop/TTL and stale-session recovery
- [ ] broader Diagnostics persistence/reload regression
- [ ] retention/cleanup boundary regression
- [ ] reboot/residue verification
- [ ] OPNsense runtime/service reliability follow-up as new evidence requires
- [ ] package/runtime version visibility follow-up
- [ ] RU/EN review beyond explicitly selected localization defects
- [ ] IPv6 Laboratory target support — requires a separate explicit architecture scope
- [ ] Additional BLOB repository GUI — wait for owner-supplied/approved technical contract

## Deferred research — do not reactivate by inertia

- [ ] candidate parallel width above three — only with new need/evidence
- [ ] endpoint-level parallelism — only with new need/evidence
- [ ] cross-batch keep-warm — only if accepted decision is invalidated by new evidence
- [ ] BLOB/Lua/discovery optimization — only after material architecture change/new evidence
- [ ] Model-C timeout/deadline audit — only for a concrete defect or explicit owner selection

## Current priority

**From the OPNsense console, use the current-tgcalls `WIRE_OK / NO_REPLY_UNKNOWN` baseline at `91.108.13.10:596` to run only temporary exact-flow/exact-endpoint non-STUN candidates with on-wire proof and exact restoration.** A successful candidate is strong causal evidence; repeated no-reply results remain inconclusive without a fresh independent endpoint control. Keep Docker `host`, add no GUI or permanent laboratory code, and do not publish the paused STUN-only `_4` as-is.
